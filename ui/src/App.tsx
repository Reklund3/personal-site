                            Leaving a secure finance career to pursue software engineering felt like jumping off a cliff,
                            but it was a jump I had to make. My background in finance instilled a sense of analytical and
                            critical thinking, skills that proved invaluable when I had to refactor a codebase, improving
                            its maintainability and reducing technical debt. This analytical approach, combined with my
                            love for building elegant and efficient solutions has contributed to my success as a software
                            engineer, through adding benchmarks, working to minify docker container image size. I enrolled
                            in Austin Coding Academy and spent every waking hour outside of my day job immersed in all the
                            tools and technologies of the trade.

                            So after finishing my boot camp I set out find my first opportunity. I reached out to some
                            peers in the industry and started asking around. I have my feet to the ground and I was
                            scanning opportunities. One opportunity was as an software development engineer in test, or
                            SDET for short. This job was appealing as it would lean on my extensive analytical skills.
                            At the same time I had an opportunity to work Cloud Imperium Games as an Associate DevOps
                            Engineer. I would quickly be thrown into learning Scala and event driven architecture. Every
                            day was a wild ride of new technology I was adding to my toolbox. The excitement was bubbling
                            out to every one around me, I was moving fast and breaking things. This is where I learned
                            function programming, up until this point I had mostly experience with C++ from 3 years of
                            advanced computer science in high school and C# from my bootcamp. And boy was functional
                            programming different. All the functional programming terms flooded in as if a tsunami had
                            been unleashed. You have you recursive, pure, and higher order functions. But, it didnâ€™t
                            stop there, Scala has tail recursive optimizations. Not only are there function methods but
                            there are functional paradigms for managing data, there is immutability, abstract data types
                            or ADTs.
